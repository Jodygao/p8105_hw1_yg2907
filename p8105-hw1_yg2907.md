library(moderndive) data(“early_january_weather”)

# Problem 1

# Names of the variables

variables \<- names(early_january_weather)

# Number of rows and columns

num_rows \<- nrow(early_january_weather) num_cols \<-
ncol(early_january_weather)

# Mean temperature

mean_temp \<- mean(early_january_weather\$temp, na.rm = TRUE)

# Results

variables num_rows num_cols mean_temp

# Plotting library

library(ggplot2)

# Scatterplot

scatterplot \<- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y =
temp, color = humid)) + geom_point() + labs( x = “Time of Observation”,
y = “Temperature”, title = “Scatterplot of Temperature vs. Time with
Humidity Color”, subtitle = “Early January Weather Data” )

# Graph

scatterplot

# Interp: Within the scatterplot, the patterns between temperature and time of observation is shown in the graph. The color of the points represents humidity levels.

# Export Graph

ggsave(“temperature_vs_time_scatterplot.png”, plot = scatterplot, width

# Problem 2

# Library data

library(dplyr)

# Data frame

my_data \<- data.frame( normal_sample = rnorm(10), \# Random sample from
a standard Normal distribution logical_vector = rnorm(10) \> 0,  
\# Logical vector indicating if elements are greater than 0
character_vector = letters\[1:10\],  
\# Character vector of length 10 factor_vector = as.factor(sample(1:3,
10, replace = TRUE))  
\# Factor vector with 3 different levels )

# Variables library

library(dplyr)

# Mean

mean_normal \<- mean(pull(my_data, normal_sample)) mean_logical \<-
mean(pull(my_data, logical_vector)) mean_character \<-
mean(pull(my_data, character_vector)) mean_factor \<- mean(pull(my_data,
factor_vector))

# To numeric

numeric_logical \<-
as.numeric(my_data$logical_vector) numeric_character <- as.numeric(my_data$character_vector)
numeric_factor \<- as.numeric(my_data\$factor_vector)

# Numeric logics successfully convert the logical vector to numeric, TRUE=1, and FALSE = 0.

# Numeric character result in NAs for all elements because character values cannot be directly converted to numeric.As I calculate the mean of character or factor variables, I need to first convert them to numeric values and then calculate the mean. However, the mean of character variables may not be meaningful.

# Finish
